"""
When lightning falls, it damages all connected neighborhoods, but the damage halves with each jump (integer division).
The lightning always jumps to a neighborhood that has the smallest distance to any neighborhood already damaged.
Note that lightning doesnâ€™t necessarily fork only at its tail.
Also, the same lightning cannot damage the same neighborhood twice.
Your job is to find the condition of the most heavily damaged neighborhood after multiple strikes on top of different city neighborhoods,
so a team of highly skilled technicians can be dispatched.
