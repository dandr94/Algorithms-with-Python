"""
We are in a rectangular room. On opposite sides of the room, there are sets of n cables (n < 1000).
The cables are indexed from 1 to n.
On each side of the room, there is a permutation of the cables, e.g. on one side we always have ordered {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
and on the other side, we have some permutation {5, 1, 3, 4, 2}.
We are trying to connect each cable from one side with the corresponding cable on the other side â€“ connect 1 with 1, 2 with 2, etc.
The cables are straight and should not overlap!
The task is to find the maximum number of pairs we can connect given the restrictions above.
